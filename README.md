# PowerShell Admin Scripts

A collection of helpful PowerShell scripts for system administration tasks, created as needed for various administrative scenarios.

## Overview

This repository contains a mix of PowerShell scripts that I've put together when the need arose during day-to-day admin work. Each script is designed to solve a specific problem or automate a particular task.

## Scripts

- **Get-DeviceIntuneComplianceStatus.ps1** - Retrieve compliance status for Intune-managed devices
- **Get-MacOSImportedDeviceIdentities.ps1** - Get imported device identities for macOS devices

- **List-AppleDepEnrollmentProfiles.ps1** - List Apple DEP enrollment profiles
- **Update-AppleDepProfileAssignment.ps1** - Update Apple DEP profile assignments

## Usage

Each script is standalone and can be run independently. Check the individual script files for specific usage instructions and requirements.
